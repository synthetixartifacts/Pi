Everything is ready 


# Context
This is the complete start of our project, nothing has been done yet and everything is to be setup.

This task is really important as it will impact the rest of the project forever so you really need to be ultra focus and ultra careful about what you do so that everything is clean, clear, well architecture and perfectly setup.
We need to always follow best practice in term of coding like DRY, reusable component and make everything clean, not too complex and perflecty balanced.

# Project
The project is described in a conversation type file in docs\project.md
You need to understand fully what we are trying to accomplish here as project.
This is the POC that will be installed in a windows, in a WSL2 / ubuntu -> docker environment.
You are also running in this environment, but not in the docker container, you live outside the docker so to execute command in docker you will be using docker.

# Task
The first thing you need to do right now is to understand our project goal / focus and objective.
Read the project file.
Then you will need to setup yourself as the primary developer for this project and update the CLAUDE.md.
Read / browse documentation 
- https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices
- https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1k5slll/anthropics_guide_to_claude_code_best_practices/?rdt=57963
- https://dev.to/yigit-konur/the-ultimate-guide-to-claudemd-best-practices-to-turn-claude-into-super-powered-ai-teammate-529p

Then backup project.md and then update it with the clean version.

# Plan
Once the project is clear, clean and ready to be setup you will create a comprehensive and ultra detailed plan that will let us go from 0 to our POC.
This plan need to be perflectly though and rethough. You will browse link there is in the backed up project.md as this is a gold mine of information of documentation and and exemple.
What I want is at the end of this plan to be able to run my project in docker and execute my POC.
The MAIN_PLAN.md will be as we said ultra detailed and we will have a way to follow where we are in it along the way, this is not something that you will execute in one execution so we need to have a way to understand where we are, what is the next step easily. Along the way we will always document with two type of documentation, the first will be the documentation of our project in term of coding/architecture etc and the second will be the how to run the project documentation (single file for this one).

As you can understand this step is ultra important and the main focus here is to do research/analysis/document and most importantly plan. Your output must be a plan that is validated by multiple source, multiple iteration. You need to think about different way we can do it, think about pro/cons about each step and always focus on the best way for our overall objective.

Do not hesitate in the middle of the execution based on your finding to challenge and revisit the inital plan and redo a planning phase, it is important that your plan go along you coding execution and your discovery.
We are in 2025, this project need to be up to date with current library. Do not forget that your training dataset is limited and you have a cutting date so make sure to use the browsing tools to double check your assumptions.
