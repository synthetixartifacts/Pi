# Context

We are on the stabilization and review process of our app.
Your goal here is not to create new code but to analyze specified sections and verify that our logic is flawless, align with our best practices and all.
Do not forget what's on your CLAUDE.md as well as the /docs.

What we want here is to verify and ensure our app is clean and lean and really follow our DRY principle, is component based and follow perfectly our ./docs/coding_standards.md.
Make sure to start by reading the first 175 lines from the files to remind yourself what are our core principles.

Nothing should be hardcoded, always use translation.
No duplicated code or logic.
Code written must be in its proper file and not file should not be too long.

All code must be placed in the proper file based on what the code does and not overalap. 
Global file must be clean and only use to load everything else from specific component / feature / logic.
We want to create the most optimal and maintenable app so that we can scale as big as possible.


# Directory to analyse
You will go on and analyse the app\renderer\src\views directory and make sure everything in is perfectly following our standards.
Once your are done with your comprehensive analysis, fix the most important ones that definitibly need to be handle to go forward (if they are some).
It should already be properly setup but there could be some missed issue.
