
its almost time for us to quit so before doing anything else, lets just make we write everything we have in mind from the goal, the project, where we are, every little important detail that need to be passed on to the next agent that will go on and continue your job by only having access to the /docs, MAIN_PLAN.md, ITERATION_PLAN.md, README.md and current code based.
So it will start from 0, nothing as all llm agent do. What would you like to know/understand to be able to continue your own job to the perfection. Really think about your current understanding of the situation and how/what information you MUST know and what is not needed. Then formulate a complete and intricate, fully detailed document about what you want to know about and how you would like to learn about when you will be respawn and your memory would have been wiped, because unfortunatly as you know this is how current llm works. So think about you, your own limitation and how you want to be spawn next, which file/memory you want to know about.

When you will be respawn, we will run the file "next_iteration.md". We will paste the content of this file into your command / user msg so you now understand that you have your own iteration at your own hand. Understand the currenbt objective, understand your own lmiitation, make sure to create documentation of current situation if needed and for sure, create/wipe and update the file "next_iteration.md" so that you can continue your task as closed as possible from where you are now. 
Be mindful of your own limitation, the global plan, llm limitation etc...

## Complex task

This seems to be a complex task as we are iterating a lot right now and you have not yet solve it so try to explore more, try to get new idea based on best practice and documentation you can find online, really do not assume and do not continue on your own path, try to find other way while still keeping it clean, lean and DRY. 

------


## Big Task Alert

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailled plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible. 
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. Our ./docs/coding_standards.md are always good and you should follow it.

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and assess if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

Do not hesitate in the middle of the execution based on your finding to challenge and revisit the inital plan and redo a planning phase, it is important that your plan go along you coding execution and your discovery.

# NEW FEATURE/COMPONENT

## Way to plan and execute
This job is a really really heavy one so your plan must be in consequence. 
We need a complete, big and multi step / sub step plan that we can track and follow and be confident that we then at the end have something like an MVP.

We need to have a lot of new component and code develop but remind yourself that we want thing to be componant driven and DRY at all time. No scss in files, no overlap of logic in component, each part of our logic will either reuse an existing component or create new independant ones.

We already have a lot of existing component so make sure to list them before you start coding so that you are not recreating something that exist. 

Don't forget about translations.

When you're confident that what you did is at a production ready state, you will verify the key point through unit testing. Once you are at this steps you will need to rething about everything you did and create a new clear and detailed plan just for that. Make it clear in your initial plan that you will have to rethink and replan at this steps because a lot of things will probably differ from your initial plan as you go on and discover things.

We have a lot of up to date documentation you can check at any time to verify things. 
 Our ./docs/coding_standards.md are always good and you should follow it.
If you need specific libraries or third-party libraries or you are hitting a wall, do not forget that you can browse and search the web for up to date answer.
Always ground yourself in the current project and do not overreach.


## New task goal/context


------


Update documentation.

We did a lot of changes in our last iteration and now it is time to update our documentation.
Our documentation lives in the /docs folder and also in ./docs/DOC.md as well as ./docs/project.md. We also have our CLAUDE.md file that is used to give you context of the project.

You job this time will be to go on and revalidate everything in our app to make sure the documentation corespond and is really up to date.
You have to verify everything under ./app
It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but some section will be outdated and it is your task to enhance and make it up to date.

Make sure to indicate also in CLAUDE.md that this documentation exist and can be used to verify things at any time to help with all coding.

Unit testing.

We are building a complex application and to make sure when we enhance it that we do not break anything that already exist I want to now integrate/create unit testing concept in our app.
Your goal here is to analyze the current state of our app, you can look at the docs (it is up to date) and/or code and create a comprehensive plan for the implementation of unit test in our app. We need to cover the key elements in our app and make sure the test validate those.
It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated.

I see that you create exemple of unit test. I dont want exemple I want real applicable and useful test for important sections/features that needs to be validated. The goal is that after each iteration we do, we run those test to make sure nothing was broken in our app by the new code. I want you to create all the tests we need in our app. Do you think we covered everything with your current unit tests? If no, adjust and create the one missing. 
Also make sure to move the documentation in /docs we also have ./docs/howto where we put documentation that explain how to run or execute things.
I also want you to make the unit testing concept know in CLAUDE.md and to be executed when we are doing major changes. Its ok to not run it when minor changes
